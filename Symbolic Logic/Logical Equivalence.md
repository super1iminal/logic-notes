# Logical Equivalence
#### Equivalence of statement forms
- **Definition 1**: Two statement forms are called logically equivalent if and only if they have identical truth values for each possible subsitution of statements for their statement variables
	- *Basically, two statement forms need to have identical truth tables*
		- *see [[Truth Tables]]*
	- The logical equivalence of statement forms P and Q is denoted by $P \equiv Q$
	- If a **statement form** is **logically equivalent**, its different forms are **logically equivalent statements**
	
### Equivalence of statements
- **Definition 2:** Two statements are called **logically equivalent** if and only if they have logically equivalent forms **when** identical component statement *variables* are used to replace identical component statements
	- basically, if the statement form of a statement is logically equivalent

### Showing Nonequivalence (of forms)
- Compare truth tables. If any truth value differes from one statement form to another, they are nonequivalent
- It is also possible to show nonequivalence by replacing statement
- Note that nonequivalence cannot be proved simply using a list of logical equivalences, however, sometimes one can quickly see that two statemetn frosm are equivalent using theorem 2.1.1
