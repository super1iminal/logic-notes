# Tautologies and Contradictions
According to the following definitions, the truth of a tautological statement and the falsity of a contradictory statement are due to the logical structure of the statements themselves and independent of the meaning of the statements
### Tautologies
A tautology is a statement form that is always true regardless of the truth values of the individual statements substituted for its statement variables
- Statement whose form is a tatuology is a tautological statment
### Contradictions
A contradiction is a statement form that is always false regardless of the truth values of the individual statements subsituted for its statement variables
- Statement whose form is a contradiction is a contradictory statement

##### Example
$p\lor\sim p$ is a **tautology**
$p\land\sim p$ is a **contradiction**

*Note: this doesn't evaluate FF and TT, but think about it*

### Logical Equivalence of Tautologies and Contradictions
*see [[Logical Equivalence]]*

if $t$ is a tautology and $c$ is a contradiction, show that $p\lor t \equiv t$ and $p \land c \equiv c$
- $p \lor t$ is logically equivalent to $p$ and **is** a tautology
- $p \land c$ is logically equivalent to $c$ and **is** a contradiction

**However,**
- $p \land t$ is logically equivalent to $p$ and is **not** a tautology
	- $p \land t \equiv p$
- $p \lor c$ is logically equivalent to $p$ and is **not** a contradction
	- $p \lor c \equiv p$

### Negation of $t$ and $c$
- $\sim t \equiv c$
- $\sim c \equiv t$
