# Universal Instantiation
- Turning compound statements into predicates, basically. Quantification of satements.
	- quantification being quantifying the number of applications the statement applies to

## Types of Universal Instantiation
- Conditional
- mod. ponens and tollens
- universal transitivity

## Quantified Error
![](../../images/Pasted_image_20221031192439.png)

## Abduction
- Basically practically applied converse error. Strong assumptions based off of invalid arguments
	- e.g. x has loud wet cough and painful lungs, so x could very well have pneumonia
		- if x has pneumonia, x has a loud wet cough

## Argument with 'no'
- no polynomial functions have horizontal asymptotes
- equivalent to, for all x, if x is a funciton with a horizontal asymptote, it is not a polynomial
