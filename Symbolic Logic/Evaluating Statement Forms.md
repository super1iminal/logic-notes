# Evaluating Statement Forms
### Computing the truth value
- To compute the truth values for a statement form, follow order of operations leading up to the boolean result

### Creating a truth table
- The **truth table** for a given statement form displays the truth values that correspond to all possible combinations of truth values for its component statement variables
	- One can make a truth table:
		- Starting with the **truth values of the statement variables**
		- Then the individual components, following the order of operations
			- Negation would be applied in a seperate step (as seen above)
		- And finally, the entire statement form
